Rootkit Programming - Exercise 1

You should have recieved the following files (in the archive ex1.tar):
 * README
 * generateSysmap.sh
 * Makefile
 * hello-1.c

Note that generateSysmap.sh relies on grep and sed to transform system.map 
into a C header file.

Furthermore, for some reason Virtualbox sometimes can't compile the thing from within a shared folder.
